# PerfGraphReporter

## Description

The [/PerfGraph.md] holds timing data and memory usage data for MOOSE applications. This Reporter stores the full performance graph from the [/PerfGraph.md] in the Reporter value `perf_graph`.

Each entry in the Reporter value `perf_graph` generated by this Reporter represents a single node in the graph with the following entries:

- `id`: A unique ID that represents the node
- `name`: The name of the section that generated the node (a section timed with `TIME_SECTION`; see [PerfGraph.md#on-the-fly-section-timing])
- `level`: The level defined for the section that generated the node (see [PerfGraph.md#logging-levels])
- `num_calls`: The number of times the section was run
- `time`: The total amount of time spent (in seconds) in the section over all runs
- `memory`: The total amount of memory (in Megabytes) that was allocated (or deallocated) during the run over all runs
- `children_ids`: The IDs of the nodes that are children to the given node (does not exist if no children exist)
- `parent_id`: The ID of the node that is the parent to the given node (does not exist for the root node)

When an application is run with multiple processes, the graph for each individual process is reported.
